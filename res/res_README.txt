This is where we will store all the images for the game. If you're an artist 
for the game, this is where you'll be submitting all your files for the game,
and where you'll be primarily working. 

Folder Guides:

  concept: Concept images used to get a feel for an artstyle/character design.
  Anyone feel free to post stuff in here if you have any character design ideas,
  though make sure you put your things in the sub-folder entitled "non-artist," 
  located inside this folder. There is a possibility these will be showcased in
  game, but not likely.
  
  sprite: Individual sprites that have yet been compressed into a sprite sheet.
  Post here and make sure your sprites fit in the window (pixel size yet to be
  decided). Only artists will be able to post in here, though Programmers will
  have access to it.
  NOTE: THIS FOLDER WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL GAME. 
  
  sprite_sheet: Contains all the sprite-sheets for the game, and where the
  programmers will be pulling from. Both programmers and artists can post 
  here, though it will have to be approved.
