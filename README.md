# TTDS
Hey, so I created this GitHub account, and now I'm officially starting this repository as a 
project for a collaborative game thing with you guys!

Still need a concept, so I'm going to leave this README.md file up. List some game concepts or design
concepts in the bottom of the file, and I can narrow down the options to some more realistic
possibilities for future development.

Still don't know what language we'll be using, but I'll be moderating this repository for updates and
stuff. Can't wait to start collaborating with you guys!
