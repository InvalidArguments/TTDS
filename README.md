# TTDS
Hey, so I created this GitHub account, and now I'm officially starting this repository as a 
project for a collaborative game thing with you guys!

Still need a concept, so I'm going to leave this README.md file up. List some game concepts or design
concepts in the ideas.md file, and I can narrow down the options to some more realistic
possibilities for future development.

Also, add your Github Username and who you are under the contributors.md file. I'll start out. This is just so
I know exactly is contributing with the pull requests and stuff. Also, list what you are good at and
what you can do. Just see my name for an example.

Still don't know what language we'll be using, but I'll be moderating this repository for updates and
stuff. Can't wait to start collaborating with you guys, this'll be a fun experience. 

   From, Rob.
 
PS: I am still learning how git hub works, so it's gonna take a bit to start actually getting this project
going. For now, just learn how to commit and do pull requests, since that's all you'll need to start. I'll
put up some more instructions in the future.

#Description

TTDS was an idea a few buddies and I came up with messing around in the dorm common room. The idea originally 
was to make a Teletubby dating sim, thus the name TTDS
